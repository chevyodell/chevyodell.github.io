          The Untitled painting shown above is an oil painting done by the polish artist Zdzisław Beksiński.
          While this may not be a titled painting it is a good representation of the kind of fantastic
          realism work that Beksiński became known for. This painting likely was created between 1960 and 1980
          during what Beksiński refered to as his own "fantastic period". Many of his paintings from this time
          comprised of gloomy, surrealistic enviroments with the subject matter being scenes of death and decay.
          The skeletal, deformed figures seen in his paintings often lie on the edge of surrealism and dreams.
