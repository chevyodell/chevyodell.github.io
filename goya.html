          The Dog (a.k.a Head of a Dog, The Buried Dog, The Half-Drowned Dog) is an oil-on-plaster painting painted by Francisco Goya sometime between
          1819 and 1823. This painting was completed during Goya's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Paintings">Black Paintings</a>
          that were painting directly onto the walls of his house when he was living on his own in his 70s, amid both mental and physical distress.

          Though it is in components a simple painting the lack of flourish brings it to bear bones.
          Many interpretations can be made about the subject matter of the painting, often despair,
          isolation and hopelessness are commonalities. Some believe it is a symbolic depiction
          of man's futile struggle against overwhelming forces. Independant of meaning the gut reaction
          is one of dry sadness.
