          The Hands Resist Him is a 1972 acrylic painting by the artist Bill Stoneham.
          Originally conceived as a painting that symbolizes the veil between awake and dreaming, and <thead>
          journey through the realm of other lives and impossibility. Though it is also quite
          creepy of a painting with and without that context. The haunting part of the painting involves
          the timeline of where it has been.

          Back in 2000 a californian couple listed it on eBay aiming to sell but also warning of a curse
          that comes with it. This curse caused the characters in the painting to move around at night,
          sometimes leave the painting and enter the room it resides in. During the time that the painting
          was for sale over 30,000 views took place with some people claiming to feel ill or have
          unpleasent experiances after viewing it. Eventually the painting was sold for $1025.00 to a gallery
          in Michigan.
