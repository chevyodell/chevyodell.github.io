      <p>
        Man Proposes, God Disposes is an 1864 oil-on-canvas painting by Edwin Landseer.
        It is inspired by the search for Franklin's lost expedition that was lost in the arctic
        in 1845. Since 1881 the painting has resided at the Royal Holloway, University of London
        where it has been frightening students ever since. There is a debunked urban legend
        where a student in the 1920s died during their exams and wrote that "the polar bears made me do it".
        This has led to the belief that students who are near it during exams will fail unless the painting
        is covered up.

         <li>can cause students to fail exams</li>
         <li>can cause student to go mad</li>
         <li>made a student stab a pencil into their eye</li>
